# XML Calabash (1.0.xx)

This project contains the "1.0" version of XML Calabash.

XML Calabash depends on Saxon and the sources vary a bit depending on
the version of Saxon that you want to use.

* The `saxon95` branch contains the sources for the Saxon 9.5 version of XML Calabash
  This is also the default branch, for lack of a better choice.
* The `saxon94` branch contains the sources for the Saxon 9.4 version of XML Calabash
* Saxon 9.3 is no longer supported. This is the "master" branch for historical reasons.
* The `docs` branch is moribund, see [the docs repo](http://github.com/ndw/xmlcalabash1-docs)
  instead.

You can download compiled versions from [XMLCalabash.com](http://xmlcalabash.com/).
